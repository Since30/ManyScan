From being a Magic Emperor to being an insignificant housekeeper, how would he get along with his \"heart demon eldest miss\" and what power would he gain in order to lead himself and the declining family to rise back to the peak of the continent!\n\n\n---\n\n**Note:** 魔 can mean \"magic\" and \"demon\", while 管家 can mean \"butler\" and \"housekeeper\". I'm not sure as to why the previous translator decided to use \"Magic\" when it's a cultivation world, but I'll just follow.
