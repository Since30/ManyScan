And I am Melody, the villainess in said novel who was punished alongside my mother for harassing the Duke's precious little girl. I didn’t want to die like that, so I decided to treat her well. I fed Loretta, put her to sleep, and played with her. And then her response was…?\n\n\"I hope Melody marries Loretta!\"\n\nThrough her endless affection, I ended up coming back with her to the Duke's mansion, where she said \"I'll stick close to Melody!\"\n\nHas there ever been anyone who is such a 'fool for Melody?!' Why am I being loved when I've only been kind to be able to live peacefully…!\n\n---\nWhen Melody discovers she's a villainess in someone else's story, being a slave dealer's daughter only adds to her guilty conscience. After her mother kidnaps Loretta, Duke Baldwin's long-lost child, Melody tries to comfort the scared little girl and forms a sisterly bond with her. So when the duke finds them, he takes both of them home because now they're inseparable! As the rest of House Baldwin becomes enamored with Melody's warm heart, will she ever learn that she deserves to be loved too?\n\n---\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EC%95%85%EC%97%AD-%EC%86%8C%EB%85%80%EB%8A%94-%EC%82%AC%EB%9E%91%EB%B0%9B%EA%B8%B0%EA%B0%80-%EB%B6%80%EB%81%84%EB%9F%AC%EC%9B%8C%EC%9A%94/3321), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/61192421)",
