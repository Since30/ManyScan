    "description": "I've reincarnated as Firentia Lombardy, the illegitimate daughter of the wealthiest and most influential family in the Empire. I thought I was all set to have a comfortable and luxurious life… but it wasn't long before my beloved father died, my relatives kicked me out, and our family went bankrupt!!\n\nTo add insult to injury, I was hit by a carriage one day when I drank (a bit too much) booze to drown my sorrows… but my despair was only temporary. When I opened my eyes, I found that I'd traveled back in time to when I was 7 years old!\n\nI was surprised to see my father again in the flesh. But as if that wasn't already shocking enough, the 2nd prince, our family's once sworn enemy, was now following me around like a dog!\n\nNow that I've been given a second chance at life, I'll take things into my own hands and claim both the 2nd prince and my family for myself!\n\n---\n* [Alternative Official English](https://tapas.io/series/i-shall-master-this-family/info)",

After being reborn, his cultivation went back to zero and he was trapped by a heart demon, given no choice but to become the housekeeper of the Luo Family's lone eldest miss. From being a Magic Emperor to being an insignificant housekeeper, how would he get along with his \"heart demon eldest miss\" and what power would he gain in order to lead himself and the declining family to rise back to the peak of the continent!\n\n\n---\n\n**Note:** 魔 can mean \"magic\" and \"demon\", while 管家 can mean \"butler\" and \"housekeeper\". I'm not sure as to why the previous translator decided to use \"Magic\" when it's a cultivation world, but I'll just follow. And Zhou Fan never does the work of a housekeeper throughout the manhua.\n\n---",

Ren, who thought such a thing was impossible, could not believe his ears when he heard his name from his mother's mouth. It was the name of a classmate who betrays the heroes in the middle of the story.\n\nOf course, he wishes to live in peace. But he meets a saint whose life he's supposed to take, and doesn't. Furthermore, he ends up saving a character (the boss of a great noble family) who was supposed to die.
