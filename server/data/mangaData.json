He’s worried that his friend will be disappointed to see Kaoru is a guy, unlike his female character in the game. But he’s the one who’s in for a surprise when, instead of another guy, his friend turns out to be a cute girl, Nanami Osaka. On top of that, Nanami told her parents that she would be bringing a friend over—a female friend. Even worse, Nanami’s dad is the super overprotective type who won’t allow any guys near his daughter. There’s only one solution to this dilemma: Kaoru has to cross-dress as a girl! Will Kaoru’s efforts pay off in the end?! Will Kaoru and Nanami remain just friends, or will their time together IRL change everything? Follow their romantic-comedy adventures to find out!",

After wandering through death for several months, she survived, but what? \n\n“I want you to break off the engagement. I want to hurry up to marry Grace.” \n\n“I want you to pretend my knight’s oath to you didn't happen.” \n\n“Give me back my heart. I’ll give it to Grace.” \n\nThe fiancé who was the male lead, the paladin and the dragon who were the sub-male leads, and the fellows all turned away. These reckless bastards! There was a lot of cursing, but what can I do to stop it? I was trying to start a new life in a cool way. By the way… \n\n“Do you know me?” \n\nHow is the dead demon king alive? \n\n“What, I don’t know…”\n\n“No, you know me. tell me Who am I?” \n\nTo make matters worse, the Demon King, who has no memory, sticks to my side and does not leave. Inevitably, I tried my best to prevent the return of the Demon King. \n\n“How can I always hold your hand?” \n\nWhy is it not enough to spit out vulgar words? \n\n“Are you going to kill all those who left you? Just speak.” \n\nHe’s even going to kill the male leads for me!",
