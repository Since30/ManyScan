The moment where Ren was about to give up the search, he decided to start playing the second round of the game.\n\nSuddenly, a notification message “Do you want to start a special story?\" appeared on the screen.\n\nWhen Ren chose “Yes” without hesitation, he lost consciousness, and when he woke up, he was a baby. —Could it be that he was reincarnated as one of the heroes in *The Legend of the Seven Heroes*? Ren, who thought such a thing was impossible, could not believe his ears when he heard his name from his mother's mouth. It was the name of a classmate who betrays the heroes in the middle of the story.\n\nOf course, he wishes to live in peace. But he meets a saint whose life he's supposed to take, and doesn't. Furthermore, he ends up saving a character (the boss of a great noble family) who was supposed to die. All of these things creates a development that he doesn't know about coming to play…\n\n---\n**Original Web Novel:** [Kakuyomu](https://kakuyomu.jp/works/16816700427572694145),  [Syosetu](https://ncode.syosetu.com/n1862hs/)",

    "description": "Kaoru Terasaki is a gamer who’s into MMORPGs, and he’s finally meeting up with someone he’s been friends with in-game for a long while—this time, offline and in person. He’s worried that his friend will be disappointed to see Kaoru is a guy, unlike his female character in the game. But he’s the one who’s in for a surprise when, instead of another guy, his friend turns out to be a cute girl, Nanami Osaka. On top of that, Nanami told her parents that she would be bringing a friend over—a female friend. Even worse, Nanami’s dad is the super overprotective type who won’t allow any guys near his daughter. There’s only one solution to this dilemma: Kaoru has to cross-dress as a girl! Will Kaoru’s efforts pay off in the end?! Will Kaoru and Nanami remain just friends, or will their time together IRL change everything? Follow their romantic-comedy adventures to find out!",
