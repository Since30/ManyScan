    "description": "In a certain place, there are two neighboring high schools. Chidori High School, a bottom-feeder boys' school where idiots gather, and Kikyo Girls' School, a well-established girls' school. Rintaro Tsumugi, a strong and quiet second year student at Chidori High School, meets Kaoruko Waguri, a girl who comes as a customer while helping out at his family's cake shop. Rintaro feels comfortable spending time with Kaoruko, but she is a student at Kikyo Girls, a neighboring school that thoroughly dislikes Chidori High. This is the story of two people who are so close and yet so far apart.\n___\n- [Official Twitter (JA)](https://twitter.com/kaoruhana_mp)",

    "description": "Kaoru Terasaki is a gamer who’s into MMORPGs, and he’s finally meeting up with someone he’s been friends with in-game for a long while—this time, offline and in person. He’s worried that his friend will be disappointed to see Kaoru is a guy, unlike his female character in the game. But he’s the one who’s in for a surprise when, instead of another guy, his friend turns out to be a cute girl, Nanami Osaka. On top of that, Nanami told her parents that she would be bringing a friend over—a female friend. Even worse, Nanami’s dad is the super overprotective type who won’t allow any guys near his daughter. There’s only one solution to this dilemma: Kaoru has to cross-dress as a girl! Will Kaoru’s efforts pay off in the end?! Will Kaoru and Nanami remain just friends, or will their time together IRL change everything? Follow their romantic-comedy adventures to find out!",

And I am Melody, the villainess in said novel who was punished alongside my mother for harassing the Duke's precious little girl. I didn’t want to die like that, so I decided to treat her well. I fed Loretta, put her to sleep, and played with her. And then her response was…?\n\n\"I hope Melody marries Loretta!\"\n\nThrough her endless affection, I ended up coming back with her to the Duke's mansion, where she said \"I'll stick close to Melody!\"\n\nHas there ever been anyone who is such a 'fool for Melody?!' Why am I being loved when I've only been kind to be able to live peacefully…!\n\n---\nWhen Melody discovers she's a villainess in someone else's story, being a slave dealer's daughter only adds to her guilty conscience. After her mother kidnaps Loretta, Duke Baldwin's long-lost child, Melody tries to comfort the scared little girl and forms a sisterly bond with her. So when the duke finds them, he takes both of them home because now they're inseparable! As the rest of House Baldwin becomes enamored with Melody's warm heart, will she ever learn that she deserves to be loved too?\n\n---\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EC%95%85%EC%97%AD-%EC%86%8C%EB%85%80%EB%8A%94-%EC%82%AC%EB%9E%91%EB%B0%9B%EA%B8%B0%EA%B0%80-%EB%B6%80%EB%81%84%EB%9F%AC%EC%9B%8C%EC%9A%94/3321), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/61192421)",
