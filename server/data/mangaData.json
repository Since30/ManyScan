The team is going through an abysmal spell right now where they are nearing the bottom of the table and have lost 5 matches in a row.

Teams don't recover. Coaches are fired, players are sold, and teams drop to lower divisions where profits often prevent them from ever being successful against even mediocre top division teams. East Tokyo United, ETU, can only blame their coach right now. And Coach is ready to give up this next game to prove to his team and fans, that against the biggest club in the nation he can make this team win.\n\n\n---\nOfficial Release:\n- English release by [INKR](https://comics.inkr.com/title/778-giant-killing?utm_source=mgd), [Azuki](https://www.azuki.co/series/giant-killing)\n- Indonesian release by Level Comics\n\n---\n- In 2010, this manga received the 34th Annual Kodansha Manga Award for General Manga.",

Chidori High School, a bottom-feeder boys' school where idiots gather, and Kikyo Girls' School, a well-established girls' school. Rintaro Tsumugi, a strong and quiet second year student at Chidori High School, meets Kaoruko Waguri, a girl who comes as a customer while helping out at his family's cake shop. Rintaro feels comfortable spending time with Kaoruko, but she is a student at Kikyo Girls, a neighboring school that thoroughly dislikes Chidori High. This is the story of two people who are so close and yet so far apart.\n___\n- [Official Twitter (JA)](https://twitter.com/kaoruhana_mp)",
