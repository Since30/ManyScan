A labyrinth would open every month, offering explorers a chance to clear it for rewards. In this world where barbarians are seen as useless in everything but battle, a barbarian who does not fight will not be able to survive. If one cannot pay the outrageous taxes demanded by the city, the only fate that awaits is a downgrade in status to a ‘lower-class citizen’. If it is revealed that you are possessing the character you are playing, you will be named an “evil spirit” and killed. The only way for Lee Hansoo to survive is to enter the labyrinth and fight while risking his life.\n\nWith the skills he has accumulated over nine years of gameplay and a stupidly strong barbarian physique, he strives to survive in this game!",

    "description": "Nearly 2000 years ago, the prosperous Han dynasty of China collapsed. Heroes rose and fell, and three nations emerged–Wei, Shu, and Wu. Historians refer to this period as the Three Kingdoms period. The romance of the three kingdoms is an intriguing tale of heroic deeds, of alliance forged and broken, of loyalty and betrayal.  \n  \nHong Kong artist Chan Mou retells this classic tale in \"The Ravages of Time\" from the perspective of the Sima clan, which in the end united the three kingdoms. Readers will be attracted by an array of well-developed characters and Chan Mou's own unique top-notch art-style. Whether you have played Dynasty Warriors or not, this is definitely worth a read!",
