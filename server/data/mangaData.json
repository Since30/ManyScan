Together, armed with Jiwoo’s super powers and Kayden’s uber-smarts, they’re out to fight those forces who would let evil rule this world. That is, if they can stand each other long enough to get the job done.\n\n---\n- [Official Simplified Chinese Translation](https://www.dongmanmanhua.cn/FANTASY/juexingbachanshiguan/list?title_no=1313)\n- [Official Spanish <Es> Translation](https://www.webtoons.com/es/action/eleceed/list?title_no=2642)\n- [Official Indonesian Translation](https://www.webtoons.com/id/fantasy/eleceed/list?title_no=2034)\n- [Official Japanese Translation](https://manga.line.me/product/periodic?id=Z0000883)\n- [Official French Translation](https://www.webtoons.com/fr/fantasy/eleceed/list?title_no=2861)\n- [Official Thai Translation](https://www.webtoons.com/th/fantasy/eleceed/list?title_no=3523)",

The team is going through an abysmal spell right now where they are nearing the bottom of the table and have lost 5 matches in a row. The losses haven't done much to team morale, because it was already low. Fan support, on the other hand, is looking bleak. In the world of football, once the fans turn on a team the end is near. Teams don't recover. Coaches are fired, players are sold, and teams drop to lower divisions where profits often prevent them from ever being successful against even mediocre top division teams. East Tokyo United, ETU, can only blame their coach right now. And Coach is ready to give up this next game to prove to his team and fans, that against the biggest club in the nation he can make this team win.\n\n\n---\nOfficial Release:\n- English release by [INKR](https://comics.inkr.com/title/778-giant-killing?utm_source=mgd), [Azuki](https://www.azuki.co/series/giant-killing)\n- Indonesian release by Level Comics\n\n---\n- In 2010, this manga received the 34th Annual Kodansha Manga Award for General Manga.",

    "description": "Kaoru Terasaki is a gamer who’s into MMORPGs, and he’s finally meeting up with someone he’s been friends with in-game for a long while—this time, offline and in person. He’s worried that his friend will be disappointed to see Kaoru is a guy, unlike his female character in the game. But he’s the one who’s in for a surprise when, instead of another guy, his friend turns out to be a cute girl, Nanami Osaka. On top of that, Nanami told her parents that she would be bringing a friend over—a female friend. Even worse, Nanami’s dad is the super overprotective type who won’t allow any guys near his daughter. There’s only one solution to this dilemma: Kaoru has to cross-dress as a girl! Will Kaoru’s efforts pay off in the end?! Will Kaoru and Nanami remain just friends, or will their time together IRL change everything? Follow their romantic-comedy adventures to find out!",

    "description": "My wicked mother brought a girl one day, the Duke's lost daughter, Loretta - the heroine of a novel called *The Duke's Four Children*. And I am Melody, the villainess in said novel who was punished alongside my mother for harassing the Duke's precious little girl. I didn’t want to die like that, so I decided to treat her well. I fed Loretta, put her to sleep, and played with her. And then her response was…?\n\n\"I hope Melody marries Loretta!\"\n\nThrough her endless affection, I ended up coming back with her to the Duke's mansion, where she said \"I'll stick close to Melody!\"\n\nHas there ever been anyone who is such a 'fool for Melody?!' Why am I being loved when I've only been kind to be able to live peacefully…!\n\n---\nWhen Melody discovers she's a villainess in someone else's story, being a slave dealer's daughter only adds to her guilty conscience. After her mother kidnaps Loretta, Duke Baldwin's long-lost child, Melody tries to comfort the scared little girl and forms a sisterly bond with her. So when the duke finds them, he takes both of them home because now they're inseparable! As the rest of House Baldwin becomes enamored with Melody's warm heart, will she ever learn that she deserves to be loved too?\n\n---\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EC%95%85%EC%97%AD-%EC%86%8C%EB%85%80%EB%8A%94-%EC%82%AC%EB%9E%91%EB%B0%9B%EA%B8%B0%EA%B0%80-%EB%B6%80%EB%81%84%EB%9F%AC%EC%9B%8C%EC%9A%94/3321), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/61192421)",
